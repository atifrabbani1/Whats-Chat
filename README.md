# WhatsChat

PURPOSE: 
This app is a Group Chat App which makes it easy for the user to interact with new people all around the world with easy signup process.

OVERVIEW:
We have used Node and Express JS to create this app. We have used Handlebars instead of HTML page that makes the code more secure and cant be viewed on the webpage. We have used MySQL to store our Database and Sequelize ORM to GET and POST into the Database. We have also used ESLint to avoid any indent error and to make the code look pretty. SOcket IO is being used for live interaction between users. It shows when the user has logged in or Logged Out and when the users are typing or how many users are online at the moment. We have used Passport NPM to implement user authentication to see if the user is logged in or not. We have also used to the technology called Bcrypt that encrypts the user password in database making it secure. In the end we have also used Bootstrap as a CSS Framework to make the app look good.

HOW TO USE:
After user navigates to website, they will be seeing the login page first. They can login if they already have the account or click the signup link just below the Login form. Once the user is signed up or Logged in , they will be routed to the chat page where they can see the message Logged in as the username. And the welcome message with their name at the top left corner of the page. They can also view the number of people that are logged in currently to the site. They can also see who is typing currently, who has joined the chat and who has left the chat. And they can chat with different people. To logout there is a Logout button at the top right corner from there they can logout of the app. And right beside the Logout button there is a settings button from there users can change their username.
